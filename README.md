4. Code (IATA/ICAO)

    IATA Code: Recognized by travelers and airlines (e.g., ATL for Atlanta).
    ICAO Code: Used in air traffic management (e.g., KATL for Atlanta).

5. Passengers

    Represents the annual volume of passengers (arrivals, departures, and transits).
    The numbers range from 75 million (for Atlanta) to approximately 20 million for smaller but significant airports.
    The cumulative passenger volume exceeds 1.65 billion, underscoring the scale of global air travel.

6. Rank Change

    Indicates whether an airport’s global importance has risen or fallen compared to the previous year.
        Example: Orlando International Airport climbed 20 ranks, showing a sharp increase in passenger volume.
        Reflects recovery trends, market shifts, and the emergence of new hubs.

7. % Change in Passenger Volume

    Captures the growth or decline in passenger traffic.
        Example: Many U.S. airports experienced a high growth rate (70-80%), likely due to recovery after travel restrictions were lifted.
        Chinese airports show a much smaller percentage increase (~8%), reflecting more stable operations or slower recovery due to regional policies.
